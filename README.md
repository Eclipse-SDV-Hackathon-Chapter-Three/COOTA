## Challenge
Update Possible Challenge: OTA updates for ECUs

## Core Idea
Implement a CI/CD-driven OTA release process with real-time monitoring and automated decision logic.
Deploy updates via canary rollout (e.g., 0.5% of devices), expand rollout progressively if telemetry shows no regression, or trigger an automatic rollback when error budgets are exceeded.
This ensures safe, scalable, and adaptive OTA deployments.
